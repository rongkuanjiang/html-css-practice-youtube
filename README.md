My first notable coding project. I learn HTML and CSS for the first time by building a youtube.com home page clone by following a free tutorial by SuperSimpleDev. In total, it took me 3-4 full days. (dec 29-30 2024, and jan 13-jan 14.)

In this video I explain the main features of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yktzxMy7GCs&ab_channel=RongkuanJiang 

In summary, the main features are:
* grid video layout
* nested layout for each video
* fixed position header and sidebar

* other features
  * media query for screen size
  * position relative and absolute for search icon tooltip and video duration
